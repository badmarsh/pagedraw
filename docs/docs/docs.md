# Docs and Projects

Pagedraw files are called docs.  Each doc has a canvas, which is what you see when you open the doc in the editor.  Each doc contains many components, which in turn each correspond to multiple `.jsx` and `.css` files.  We call Pagedraw docs “docs” and React source code “files” to avoid confusion.

Docs live in projects.  Projects contain multiple docs. Users have access to one or more projects.  If you have access to a project, you have read and write access to all the docs in the project.  No one who doesn’t have access to the project can read or write any docs in the project.

To create a new doc in Pagedraw, go to the dashboard at [https://pagedraw.io/apps/](https://pagedraw.io/apps/), enter the doc name in the field `New doc name` and click the `ADD` button
