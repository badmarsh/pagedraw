# Don't edit the generated code

We think this topic is so important that we wrote an entire [blog post about it](https://medium.com/pagedraw/to-round-trip-or-to-not-round-trip-8a286de67c23). 

tldr: we believe a product that lets you edit generated code is actually much worse. Plus, there are ways to write HTML code by hand in Pagedraw if you want to, heavily inspired by the way GCC lets you link Assembly files from your C files.
