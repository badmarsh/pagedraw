## Sketch Importer Server

The sketch importer requires a Mac since it depends on `sketchtool`, from the makers of Sketch, which is only available on MacOS.  In order to run this on a server, you need a Mac server.

### Setting up a new Mac as a sketchimporter server

This is a rough guide.  The exact steps are undocumented and messy.

1. Install sketchtool.  Look at https://www.sketchapp.com/tool/

2. Install NodeJS.  Last tested @ v8.4.0.
