Pagedraw scripts
========

All scripts assume that the current working directory is Pagedraw's root directory. For this reason, scripts cannot be
run directly from the shell via something like `./script.sh`. Use `yarn run` instead.

For example, if you'd like to run the `deploy.sh` script, execute
```
yarn deploy
```
from the root directory.
